# MT22PenguinProjectAssessment

This repository is an analysis of gentoo penguin bill length and body mass in R. Both a linear regression and a piecewise regression are completed in order to analyse what best models the relationship between bill length and body mass. The script is in the main repository. The raw data, which can also be sourced from the palmerpenguins library, is in the raw_data folder. The script first wrangles the data set for analysis by cleaning and then subsetting for just gentoo penguins data. The linear regression and piecewise regression are modelled and plotted. Discussions are included too. Lastly, the plots, statistic test summmaries and session summary are saved to the out folder (figures folder within for plots).
